<h1>Some Things I Have Made</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://61fresh.com">61Fresh</a>
    <p>61Fresh is a Twitter-powered Boston news aggregator. I built a system that follows hundreds of thousands of Boston tweeters, and this site highlights the local stories they're tweeting about right now. The Nieman Journalism lab <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/09/the-hub-of-the-twitterverse-the-boston-globe-has-built-a-localized-tweet-powered-news-aggregator/">wrote it up</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://snd-hmpgr.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">Hmpgr</a>
    <p>For the SNDMakes hackathon, my team prototyped a tool for editing a homepage via direct manipulation. In this demo, you can drag articles around th page, slot new stories, and even edit headlines. <a href="https://github.com/Upstatement/snd_layout_editor">The git repo is here.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/danielsmc/twitter-bingo">Twitter Bingo</a>
    <p>Twitter Bingo is a tool for creating scavenger hunt bingo games, played entirely through Twitter.</p>

    <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/specials/marathon_fullvideo/">Marathon Bombing Video</a>
    <p>The week following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing was my first experience building interactives in the newsroom. With the story moving so quickly, turnaround times were tight. This video player with synced annotations went from conception to release in about a day.</p>

    <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/2013/11/20/jfk/nTpacf5yvsiMNjDna8giFI/story.html">A Nation Changed: Globe Coverage of the Kennedy assassination</a>
    <p>One of the treasures of a paper like the Globe is its archives. I built this interactive to let readers follow along as a breaking story unfolded, fifty years after the fact.</p>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/05/25/baby-picture-web/panNmFmuc7sI9ncvzQ2r1O/igraphic.html">A Baby Picture of the Web</a>
    <p>A short article I wrote for the Globe, looking back at the first web page. This piece also ran in print.</p>

  <li>
    <a href="http://smalldesignfirm.com/project/new-york-historical-society/#new-york-rising">New York Rising</a>
    <p>This interactive museum exhibit for the New-York Historical Society uses augmented reality and hypertext to connect objects and tell the stories of New York during and after the Revolutionary War. I did almost all the programming and a good amount of the design work.</p>
